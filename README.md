1-How to install and setup
Download all files to your computer, you will need to also download a few dependancies.
A file called requirements.txt lists them but for the sake of simplicity i am going to list them here as well.
The dependencies you need are:

#Pynput
#Pyinstaller (optional)

Optionally,once you have finished the previous step, you can create an executable version (.exe) using pyinstaller. Installing the dependencies and creating the executable file requires PIP installed. If you do not have PIP installed or if you have trouble creating the executable, this is a great tutorial that helped me along the way:

2-How to use
Once you run the program, every keystroke will be saved to the log.txt file. To run the program open a command promp and navigate to the folder containing the keylogger.py file. Than, run the "python3 keylogger.py" file.

This is version 1.0 of the program, if you run into problems or would like to ask me questions please contact me at
